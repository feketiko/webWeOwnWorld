                        <h3>What is <strong>overpopulation?</strong> </h3>
                        <p> <strong>Overpopulation</strong> is an undesirable condition where the number of existing human population exceeds the carrying capacity of Earth. <strong>Overpopulation</strong> is caused by number of factors. Reduced mortality
                            rate, better medical facilities, depletion of precious resources are few of the causes which results in overpopulation. It is possible for a sparsely populated area to become densely populated if it is not able to sustain life.
                            Growing advances in technology with each coming year has affected humanity in many ways. One of these has been the ability to save lives and create better medical treatment for all. A direct result of this has been increased
                            lifespan and the growth of the population.
                        </p>
                        </br>
                        <p>In the past fifty or so years, the growth of population has boomed and has turned into overpopulation. In the history of our species, the birth and death rate have always been able to balance each and maintain a population growth
                            rate that is sustainable.</p>

                            <li>
                                <h4> <strong>Better Education</strong> </h4>
                                <p>One of the first measures is to implement policies reflecting social change. Educating the masses helps them understand the need to have one or two children at the most. </p>

                                <h4> <strong> Making People Aware of Family Planning</strong></h4>
                                <p>One of the best way is to let them know about various safe sex techniques and contraceptives methods available to avoid any unwanted pregnancy.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4> <strong>Tax Benefits or Concessions</strong> </h4>
                                <p>Government of various countries might have to come with various policies related to tax exemptions to curb overpopulation. As we humans are more inclined towards money, this may produce some positive results.</p>

                                <h4> <strong>Knowledge of Sex Education</strong> </h4>
                                <p>Imparting sex education to young kids at elementary level should be must. Most parents feel shy in discussing such things with their kids which result in their children going out and look out for such information on internet
                                    or discuss it with their peers. </p>
